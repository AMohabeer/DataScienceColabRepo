Histology Definition
Histology is the study of the microscopic anatomy (microanatomy) of cells and tissues. 
Every cell of tissue type is unique, based on the many functions an organism carries out.
 Histology uses advanced imaging techniques to analyze and identify the tissues and structures present. 
Both light microscopy and specialized systems such as electron microscopy are used to visualize the tiny structures 
present in specially prepared tissue samples. The histology of different tissues can be used to identify unknown tissues, 
provide clues to the function of tissue or cells, or even identify disease in the cells of an organism.

Histopathology is the microscopic examination of tissues to diagnose and manage diseases, especially cancer.

Histopathology is the branch of histology that includes the microscopic identification and study of diseased tissue.
 It is an important part of anatomical pathology and surgical pathology, as accurate diagnosis of cancer and other diseases
 often requires histopathological examination of tissue samples.
